If you use Kinetix to export a 4K video on **Google Chrome**, it takes about 10 seconds.
If you try the same export on **Firefox**, it might take 2 minutes, or crash.

Why the huge difference? And how do we handle it?

## The Engine: WebCodecs

Kinetix uses the modern **WebCodecs API** to encode video directly in the browser. This allows us to access the hardware video encoder (NVENC on Nvidia, VideoToolbox on Mac) without any server-side rendering.

### Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
Chromium has the most mature implementation of `VideoEncoder`.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Native support for H.264 and VP9.
- **Speed:** Can process frames as fast as the GPU allows.
- **Stability:** Handles large buffers (4K textures) gracefully.

### Firefox (Gecko)
Firefox supports WebCodecs (as of version 130+), but the implementation varies significantly by OS.
- on many Windows machines, it falls back to **Software Encoding** (OpenH264), which eats CPU and freezes the main thread.
- memory management for large `ImageBitmap` transfers is stricter, leading to frequent allocation failures during heavy exports.

### Safari (WebKit)
Safari's implementation is relatively new and often lacks support for specific container muxing features we rely on for standard MP4s.

## The UX Solution: Smart Warnings

We don't want to block Firefox users, but we owe them a heads-up. We implemented a `BrowserDetector` to check the environment before export.

```typescript
// utils/BrowserDetector.ts
export class BrowserDetector {
    static isChromium(): boolean {
        // Feature detection + UA check for Chromium engine
        return !!window.chrome && !navigator.userAgent.includes('Firefox');
    }
}
```

If a user tries to export on a non-Chromium browser, we inject a friendly warning into the UI:

> **Recommended Browser**
> You are using **Firefox**. Video export is experimental on this browser.
> For 20x faster exports and better stability, please use **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.

## Implementation

We added this check directly to our `ExportDialog` component.

```tsx
// EditorLayout.tsx
{isBrowserWarning && (
    <div className="bg-orange-50 text-orange-800 p-4 rounded-xl">
        You are using {BrowserDetector.getBrowserName()}. 
        Switch to Chrome for better performance.
    </div>
)}
```

This simple check saves our users from frustration and reduces "My export crashed" support tickets by explaining the limitation upfront.

## Summary

- **WebCodecs** is the future, but browser support is uneven.
- **Chrome/Edge** are currently the only reliable options for heavy 4K encoding.
- **User Education** via in-app warnings is better than silent failures.
