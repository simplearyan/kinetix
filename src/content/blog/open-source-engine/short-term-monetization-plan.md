**Goal**: Generate $1k - $5k/month immediately to fund development, without building a massive company yet.

Since you cannot wait for Enterprise deals, we will use the **"Indie Hacker / Sponsorware"** model.

## Strategy 1: The "Insiders" Program (Immediate Recurring Revenue)
Don't give everything away. Open Source the **Core**, but keep the **Cool Stuff** for Sponsors.

*   **The Offer**: "Sponsor me at $25/month to get access to the `kinetix-insiders` repo."
*   **What's Inside**:
    *   The [ParticleText](file:///d:/Code/Antigravity/design_concepts/kinetix/src/engine/objects/ParticleTextObject.ts#21-224) object.
    *   The `Facebook/Instagram` export presets.
    *   The React Components (`@kinetix/react`) before public release.
*   **Why it works**: Developers will pay $25 to save 5 hours of work implementing particles.
*   **Platform**: GitHub Sponsors or Polar.sh.

## Strategy 2: "Paid Bounties" (Immediate One-Off Cash)
Instead of waiting for generic sponsors, find 3-5 founders building Video AI tools.
*   **The Pitch**: "I see you are building an AI video generator. My engine handles the rendering. I will implement a custom `SubtitleObject` for your app for $500."
*   **Result**: You get paid to build features that end up in your Open Source engine anyway.

## Strategy 3: The "Template Marketplace" (Micro-Transactions)
Sell **Project Files** (JSONs), not just the engine.
*   **Product**: "Social Media Starter Pack" (5 high-quality animated templates).
*   **Price**: $19 one-time.
*   **Target**: Indie hackers who want to add video to their MVP but suck at design.
*   **Platform**: Gumroad or Lemon Squeezy.

## The 3-Month Execution Plan

### Month 1: Hype & Traffic
1.  **Launch on Hackernews/Reddit**: "I built an Open Source alternative to Remotion".
2.  **Call to Action**: "Sponsor for $10 to get the React Bindings beta".
3.  **Goal**: 10 Sponsors ($100/mo) + 500 GitHub Stars.

### Month 2: The Service Hustle
1.  **Cold DM Founders**: Find people launching "AI Short Generators" on Product Hunt.
2.  **Offer**: "I'll optimize your rendering pipeline for a flat fee."
3.  **Goal**: 1 Contract ($1k - $2k).

### Month 3: The Asset Launch
1.  Package your best "Text Animations" into a JSON pack.
2.  Sell it on Gumroad.
3.  **Goal**: $500 in sales.

## Summary
You are not a "Company" yet. You are a **Specialized Consultant** selling a **Premium Library**.
1.  Free: The Core Engine.
2.  Paid: The "Insiders" Features.
3.  Services: Custom implementation for startups.
