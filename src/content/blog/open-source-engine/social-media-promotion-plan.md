**Goal**: Drive traffic to your tools (Data Animator) and convert 1% of that traffic into GitHub Sponsors.

You cannot just ask for money. You have to **Give Value** first.

## 1. Reddit Strategy: The "Indie Hacker" Narrative
Don't post ads. Post "Stories". Reddit hates self-promotion but loves "I built this cool thing".

**Subreddits**: r/javascript, r/reactjs, r/webdev, r/dataisbeautiful, r/ SideProject.

*   **The "Showoff" Post (r/reactjs)**:
    *   **Title**: "I built a client-side alternative to Remotion that renders 60fps video in the browser."
    *   **Content**: A 30-second video showing the smooth timeline and resize.
    *   **The Ask**: "Open source on GitHub. If you use it, buy me a coffee."
*   **The "solution" Post (r/dataisbeautiful)**:
    *   **Title**: "I got tired of Flourish adding watermarks, so I built a free, private Bar Chart Race generator."
    *   **Content**: A high-quality Bar Chart Race video. Link to your tool in comments.

## 2. X (Twitter) Strategy: "Building in Public"
Twitter is for the "Journey".

*   **Day 1**: "Starting work on the React Bindings for Kinetix. Remotion is cool, but I want something that runs purely in Canvas." #buildinpublic
*   **Day 7**: "Finally figured out the 'Smart Scaling' logic using Vector math. Here is the before/after." (Attach video).
*   **The "Viral" Thread**: "How to build a Video Editor in the browser (A Thread 🧵)".
    *   Tweet 1: The architecture.
    *   Tweet 2: The loop.
    *   Tweet 3: The export.
    *   Final Tweet: "The code is Open Source here. Sponsors get early access to the Particle System."

## 3. YouTube Strategy: "The Education Hook"
Don't just demo the tool. Teach people **How to Build It**.

*   **Video 1**: "Coding a Bar Chart Race from SCRATCH in React (No Libraries)".
    *   People watching this are **Developers** (your target sponsors).
    *   Mid-roll: "I actually turned this into a library called Kinetix. You can use it today."
*   **Video 2**: "Top 5 Free Tools for Animated Charts (Better than Flourish)".
    *   List 4 competitors, and put YOUR tool at #1.

## 4. The Funnel (How to get money)
Traffic -> Tool -> **"Support the Dev"** Button.

1.  **The "Free Tool" Page**:
    *   User creates a Chart.
    *   User clicks "Export MP4".
    *   **While Rendering**: Show a modal. *"This tool is free and privately hosted by me. If it saved you time, please consider donating $5."*
    *   Button: "Support on GitHub Sponsors".

## Summary
*   **Reddit**: Get the initial spike of users (The "Hacker" crowd).
*   **X (Twitter)**: Build the long-term brand (The "Founder" crowd).
*   **YouTube**: Capture the search traffic (The "Learner" crowd).

**Key Rule**: 80% Give, 20% Ask.
