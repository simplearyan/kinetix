# Kinetix Studio: A New Era for Web Animation

We are thrilled to announce a comprehensive overhaul of the Kinetix platform. This update transitions us from a prototype to a robust, scalable video creation suite. Here is a detailed breakdown of everything we've shipped today.

## 🚀 New Core Engine

At the heart of this update is our new **Engine Core** (`src/engine/`). We've moved away from simple DOM manipulation to a performant, requestAnimationFrame-driven architecture.

-   **Scene Graph**: A true object-oriented scene graph managing all renderable items.
-   **Object System**: Modular support for **Rich Text**, **Charts**, **Code Blocks** (syntax highlighted), and **Images**.
-   **Playback Control**: Precise time management with Play, Pause, Seek, and Loop capabilities.
-   **Export System**: Native WebM video export (simulating 60FPS) and high-quality PNG/SVG snapshots.

## 🎨 Studio UI Redesign

We've completely reimagined the `/create` and `/studio` experience with a modern, "dark-first" interface that puts creativity front and center.

### 1. Activity Bar & Drawer
The sidebar has been refactored into a **Slim Activity Bar** for quick tab switching, paired with an expandable **Drawer** for browsing assets. This maximizes canvas space while keeping tools accessible.

### 2. Properties Panel & Inspector
A context-aware **Properties Panel** now lives on the right. Select an object to edit its specific attributes (Color, Font, Size, Data), or deselect everything to tweak **Scene Settings** like Resolution (480p to 4K) and Background Color.

### 3. Layer Management
We've introduced a full-featured **Layers Tab** to manage complex scenes:
-   **Reorder**: Drag (or use arrows) to change Z-index.
-   **Rename**: Keep your project organized with custom names.
-   **Lock/Hide**: Prevent accidental edits or temporarily hide elements.
-   **Duplicate/Delete**: Quick actions for rapid iteration.

## ✨ New Creative Features

### Animation Presets
Bring your static designs to life! We've added an **Animations** tab to the Properties panel.
-   **One-click Presets**: Fade In, Slide Up, Typewriter, and more.
-   **Live Previews**: Hover over a preset card to see it in action before applying.

### Canvas Guides
Perfect your composition with our new overlay guides:
-   **Center**: Standard crosshairs.
-   **Rule of Thirds**: For cinematic framing.
-   **Golden Ratio**: For balanced, aesthetically pleasing layouts.
Toggle them instantly from the new Grid icon in the header.

### Typography
We now support a curated list of web-safe and Google Fonts, including **Inter, Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Georgia, Impact**, and **Comic Sans MS** (because why not?).

### Enhanced Export
The export flow is now smoother and more powerful:
-   **Settings Dialog**: Choose your Filename, Format (WebM/MP4), and Duration.
-   **Snapshots**: Grab a quick PNG of the current frame.
-   **PWA Icon**: A sharply defined SVG icon for our Progressive Web App installation.

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

-   **Refined Editor Layout**: Fixed scrollbars, layout shifts, and responsive behavior.
-   **Performance**: Optimized rendering loop to only redraw when necessary.
-   **Bug Fixes**: Resolved timeline synchronization issues and export timing glitches.
