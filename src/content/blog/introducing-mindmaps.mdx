# Introducing New Mindmaps

We're excited to share a massive upgrade to one of your most-loved visuals: **Mindmaps**.

As our most generated visual type, many of you have been asking for more flexibility. That's why we've expanded beyond a single format to give you multiple designs, each with various styles, orientations, and the ability to edit them easily.

## Why Mindmaps?

Mindmaps are perfect for:
* Brainstorming sessions
* Organizational charts
* Project planning
* Learning concepts

## How to use

Simply type your ideas in a nested list format in the Kinetix editor:

```text
Mindmap:
Main Topic
  Subtopic 1
  Subtopic 2
```

And watch it transform instantly!
