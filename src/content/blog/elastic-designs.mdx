# Introducing Elastic Designs - Get The Right Visuals, Faster

Kinetix visuals just got better.

With **Elastic Designs**, your visuals now scale automatically with your content and support more complex structures without breaking the layout.

## What is Elastic Design?

Imagine a diagram that breathes. As you add more text to a node, the box expands, the arrows adjust, and the surrounding layout shifts to accommodate the new content—all in real-time.

### Key Benefits

1.  **Dynamic Resizing**: No more manually dragging borders.
2.  **Smart Layouts**: The engine understands the relationship between nodes.
3.  **Consistency**: Maintain uniform spacing and alignment automatically.

## How to try it

Just start typing in the editor. Whether you have a single word or a paragraph, the visual will adapt seamlessly.
